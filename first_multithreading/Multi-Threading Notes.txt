Multi-Threading Notes:
- Multithreading allows your computer to perform actions in parallel, utilizing multiple cores/ multiple CPUs present on your system.
- Thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time and you don't know which thread will execute first. This scenario is called "race condition".
- import threading
- Lock Objects: Most basic synchronzation primitive which is not owned by a particular thread when locked. It doesnt keep info about which thread has a permit of the lock, any thread can release the lock
- The lock object has 2 states: "locked" and "unlocked".
- The lock object is in the "unlocked" state when it is created
- The lock object has only 3 methods: acquire(), release(), locked()
